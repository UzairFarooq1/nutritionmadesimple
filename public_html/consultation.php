      <p>We are excited to be working with you at Nutrition Made Simple Ltd! Here is our consultancy structure that will help us to provide you with the best support possible. </p>
      <p>At your first consultation we will have a virtual call as I review your medical history, family history, current symptoms, any medications taken and look at your current diet and lifestyle and also discuss your aims and what you want to get out of our sessions.

<p>We will work together to create a personalised plan for you based on dietary changes, lifestyle suggestions and supplementation where needed.  You will receive this plan and any supporting resources within 2 working days of your consultation.

<p>Usually multiple follow up sessions are required which is why the value package I offer.  The number needed will vary from person to person but around 4 is most common</p>

<h1>Online Sessions</h1>

<p>Please attend your sessions regularly, but if you need to cancel, let your dietitian or our admin team know via email at least 48 hours before your session. Please note that if you miss or cancel a session with less than 48 hours' notice, you will not be entitled to a full refund, admin and Additional costs will be deducted and will receive a 50% refund. </p>

<p>If you have booked a package and no longer wish to continue with your appointments you will receive a refund of 50% for the remaining appointments 
If you miss an appointment as part of a package you will not receive an additional appointment. Video consultations will be completed via Zoom or Google Meet. It is your responsibility to ensure you have working internet and are in an environment that permits the discussion of personal information.
</p>

<h1>Confidentiality and Support</h1>

<p>All client status and discussions during your sessions with your dietitian are confidential. However, if your dietitian has serious concerns about your safety or someone else's, or if required by law, we may need to contact your GP or relevant authorities.</p>

<p>Your dietitian will keep a password-protected record of your name, contact details, and appointment dates and times. They will also keep a brief note on the focus of your work, which is also password-protected. Any reports that your dietitian generates for the evaluation of our service will contain anonymized data and no identifying information.
</p>
    
<p>We are here to support you every step of the way and look forward to working with you!ðŸ˜‰</p>
